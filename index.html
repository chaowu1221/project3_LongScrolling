    <h2> Monster Hunter : World </h2>

    <p>
      As a long-awaited console platform work, the Monster Hunter:World released last year excited old players and attracted countless new players into this classical series that was born 20 years ago.
      What really surprised me was that "Iceborne" in "Monster Hunter : World" did not simply and rudely increase the playing time by stacking new monsters, maps, and weapons, but indeed in the game experience make some new efforts and attempts.

    <h2>New Face Vs Old Face</h2>
    <p>
      Capcom is offering the same number of new monsters in the "Iceborne"  as it did when the game was first released, and these monsters can be easily divided into new original monsters, returning classic monsters and subspecies monsters.
      For new players, they may not be all that different, just weapons waiting to be peeled and stripped. While for old hunters of this series, it was quite a surprised and touched that when they saw some returning of these weapons and witness the growth of Monster Hunter.

    <h2>Ecological Chain in Monster Hunter</h2>
    <p>
      The newly added "Monster Hunter" ecological chain faces also impressive. Most of these new monsters fit perfectly with the plot trend of this game and the new map ecosystem, and the shape and action design are also attentive. Many new monsters have new ways of attacking and living habits. For example, the giant tyrannosaurus will sunbathe and drink hot spring water at leisure. Once in the combat state, it will roll up the trunk with huge horns and go forward Momentum rushed towards the hunter. The new ancient dragons, such as Lu Bolong and Tiandi Huang crying dragon, have domineering shapes and full of oppressive fighting methods. The hunting process is also full of freshness.
